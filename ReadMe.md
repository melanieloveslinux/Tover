# Intro
Tover is a cursor hovering mini-game made in Python.  Hover over the label which says "Hover" as fast as you can!

# To Install
There isn't any binary for this, just download the "main.py" file and run with python `Python main.py`.

If you're on Windows, you may need to install [Python]([https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run the program.

If you're on Linux, you may need to install [Tk](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) for the tkinter library to work.  Since I'm developing on Arch Linux, I had to install the 'tk' package `pacman -S tk`.
