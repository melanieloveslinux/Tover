# Intro

Tover is a mouse hovering mini-game made in TkInter. This project has no practical use outside of familiarising myself with tkinter for another upcoming project (TyPyer).

# To Use
Eye Dee Kay (IDK) what to write right now.  For Arch users (me), Python should already be installed however you will also need to install the "tk" package.

`pacman -S tk`
